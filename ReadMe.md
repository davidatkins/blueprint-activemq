This is a fork of the activemq docker container provided in the Fabric8 v3 quickstarts - https://github.com/fabric8io/quickstarts/tree/master/apps/fabric8-mq. This fork has been created to provide a demo project to try out various approaches to docker container definition and development lifecycles. Note this isn't a true fork because i've only taken a sub module to create a standalone module.

The major difference between this and the fabric8 version is the use of XML files to configure activemq. This should be provided as a pull request to Fabric8 at some point, see https://github.com/fabric8io/fabric8/issues/3478.
